                                                  School Management System
Stage 1:

## Description:

This system is designed to manage a school's administrative operations, including employee information, budgeting, procurement, and financial transactions.

Data Entities:

•	__Employee__ (***Employee_ID***,Employee_Name, Seniority, Contact_Information, Job_Title)

•	__Budget__ (***Budget_Code***, _Employee_ID_, Expense_Category, Budget_Amount, Budget_Year)

•	__Supplier__ (***Supplier_ID***, Supplier_Name, Contact_Information, Inventory)

•	__Invoice__ (***Invoice_ID***, _Supplier_ID_, Invoice_Cost, Invoice_Date)

•	__Orders__ (***Order_ID***, _Supplier_ID_, _Employee_ID_, Invoice_ID, Quantity)

•	__Payment__ (***Payment_ID***, _Employee_ID_, Amount, Payment_Purpose, Payment_Date)


**Relationships:**

• An ***Employee*** may be associated with multiple ***Budgets*** (via Employee_ID in Budget).

• An ***Employee*** can initiate multiple Orders and receive multiple ***Payments*** (via Employee_ID in Orders and Payment).

• A ***Supplier*** can have multiple ***Orders*** placed with them (via Supplier_ID in Orders).

• Each ***Order*** is tied to a single Supplier and a single ***Invoice*** (via Supplier_ID and Order_ID in foreign keys).

• Each ***Invoice*** is linked to a single ***Order*** (via Order_ID in foreign key).

• Each ***Supplier*** must have exactly one Invoice associated with them, and each Invoice must be associated with exactly one ***Supplier***.

**Functionality:**

This database schema allows you to manage various aspects of a school's financial operations:

• Record and manage employee information, including their roles and contact details.

• Define and track budgets allocated to different expense categories, ensuring efficient financial management.

• Maintain supplier details, including their names, contact information, and inventory levels (if applicable).

• Create and manage purchase orders placed with suppliers, tracking details such as order quantities and delivery dates.

• Process invoices received from suppliers for placed orders, ensuring accurate billing and payment reconciliation.

• Record payments made to employees for salaries, bonuses, or grants, enabling efficient payroll processing and financial reporting.

## ERD:
 ![Entity-Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/shay0129/DBProject_315689042_314695438/blob/main/Stage.1/ERD/ERD.png)

The ERD was chosen to accurately represent the key components and relationships involved in the procurement process, employee payroll process, and budget management process.

1. Procurement Process:

Suppliers, Orders, Invoices.

2. Employee Payroll Process:

Employees, Payments, Budget.

3. Management Process:

Budgets, Employees.
